# JS Elzero Tasks

This repository contains solutions to JavaScript tasks and challenges inspired by Elzero Web School. The tasks are organized by number and cover a wide range of JavaScript concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics.

## Structure

The workspace is organized into folders by task number:

```
Task1[1-9]/
Task2[10-17]/
Task3[18-22]/
...
Task26[179-188]/
```

Each task folder may contain several assignments (`ass1`, `ass2`, etc.), and each assignment typically includes an `index.html` and a `script.js` file. Some folders also contain challenge subfolders.

## How to Use

1. **Open in VS Code**: Open the repository in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Browse Tasks**: Navigate to any task folder and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the solution in action.
3. **Edit/Run Code**: Modify the `script.js` files to experiment with the code or try your own solutions.

## Example

To view the solution for Task 17 Challenge:

- Open [`Task17[94-101]/Chalange/index.html`](Task17[94-101]/Chalange/index.html) in your browser.
- The logic is implemented in [`Task17[94-101]/Chalange/script.js`](Task17[94-101]/Chalange/script.js).

## Topics Covered

- JavaScript basics (variables, loops, functions)
- DOM manipulation
- Object-oriented programming
- ES6+ features (classes, destructuring, etc.)
- Practical coding challenges

## Credits

- Inspired by [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org/) JavaScript course.
